## How to run it?

1. Open terminal and run

```sh
python "C:\Program Files\metadata-editor\script.py"
```

2. It will ask for path, so give the file or folder path as the input.
   for **batch metadata editing** give folder path. example: `D:\Media\movies`
   for **single file metadata editing** give video file (mp4 or mkv) path. example: `D:\Media\movies\Oldboy 2160p DC [2003].mkv`
